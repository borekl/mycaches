# MyCaches

Simple web app for keeping track of my
[geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com/) finds and hides. Created to
replace a manually maintained HTML page. Written in perl, it originally used
Web::Simple micro-framework and then rewritten using Mojolicious web
framework (primarly because I wanted to learn Mojolicious).
